        <p style="text-indent: 40px"> I started my professional career with a job at PACCAR, Inc working for the Embedded Engineering department directly out of college.
            I received an offer to become a software engineer on a Windows application that's purpose was to facilitate building and servicing
            heavy duty trucks. Our application is a combination of Java and C# and creates a dynamic application that is used globally.
            During my time as a software engineer, I was tasked with creating algorithms that would perform a number of different tasks through communication with
            embedded devices. Those embedded devices (Electronic Control Units - ECUs) would then perform actions that would diagnose whether the system was working properly.
            The other side of what our team handled was the updating of those ECUs. </p>
        <p style="text-indent: 40px"> One of my greatest accomplishments as a software engineer for PACCAR, Inc was my contribution to the launch of the PACCAR 12 speed transmission.
            I spent many hours learning a new (to me) protocol for CAN (J1939) that was used to communicate with the transmission controller. This required learning a new skill in that
            there was a lot of time debugging wiring issues. On the software side, we were tasked with trying to trim down the time it took to update the ECU from 3 minutes down to 1.5.
            While I was successful in optomizing the solution from 3 minutes to a stable 2 minutes, this still was too long for our manufacturing plants. As a result, we were tasked with
            creating a new station strictly for programming the transmission controller. I was in charge of analyzing the requirements from the manufacturing engineer, and creating a design
            that would satisfy all stakeholders. </p>
